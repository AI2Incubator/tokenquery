# tokenregex
A naive implementation of token regex in python


Idea is taken from this paper :
http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/tokensregex-tr-2014.pdf

But there are some difference in the language 


## coming up next
- Spans for tokens
- More NLP tools and adding labels
  - POS
  - Semantic Roles like NER
  - IOB format for chunk labels
  - Dependency trees 
- Named capturing
- Macros:
- Matching multiple regular expressions
